# GooseART Website

## Run with npm

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The site is configured for Vite and can be deployed on Render.

## Contact form

The Contact page is connected to Formspree using the provided endpoint:

`https://formspree.io/f/xqpzbdyq`

The form uses vanilla JavaScript/AJAX with `fetch()` and sends an `Accept: application/json` header, so visitors stay on the GooseART site after submitting.

Formspree controls where submissions are delivered. Make sure the Formspree form is verified/configured for Paige's email address in the Formspree dashboard.

## Other commands

- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`
